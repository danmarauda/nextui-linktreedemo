            This github project aims to create a web application similar to
            Linktree; it uses NextUI, and all buttons will link to any of your
            personal social media accounts. I made it very easy for anyone to
            change and edit any of the links and avatars. The snippet on the top
            right of the card is made for your personal website, which you can
            share with other people.
